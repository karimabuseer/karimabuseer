Hello there! I'm Karim, a passionate junior full-stack developer from London. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and the world in an equitable way. I'm a little addicted to cracking algorithms and neatening up my code right now, and having a crazy amount of fun doing so.
## Skills
- Languages: Ruby, Python, C
- Interpersonal Skills: I've had the privilege of leading volunteering teams for most of my adult life, alongside working as a Sales Representative for a SaaS start-up for over a year, which has left me with an intimate understanding of how to manage multiple stakeholders, and how to communicate with varying personality types

## Proudest Achievements

  - Completing CS50 in 3 weeks, whilst simultaneously self teaching Python
  - Being one of the head honchos at the London Wargaming Guild; the world's biggest Warhammer club (and a safe place where anyone can enjoy wargaming/board games)
  - Being a loving son to my mother, and caring brother to my wonderful siblings

## What I'd like to work on

I'd also love to eventually work in a role either focused towards big data, or towards AI - though I'm not at a level where I'd be confident of my ability to contribute meaningfully.
