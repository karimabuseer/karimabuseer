# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! I'm Karim, a passionate junior full-stack developer from London. The midwife who delivered me declared I'd be a gigantic nerd to my mother, and happily she was proven correct. 

I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and the world in an equitable way. I'm earnestly excited about software that can help us tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, and am currently learning to become a fully fledged developer, so I can contribute to projects in a meaningful fashion. 

Right now I'm a little addicted to cracking algorithms and neatening up my code right now, and having a crazy amount of fun doing so.

## Skills
- Languages: Ruby, Python, C
- Interpersonal Skills: I've had the privilege of leading volunteering teams for most of my adult life, alongside working as a Sales Representative for a SaaS start-up for over a year, which has left me with an intimate understanding of how to manage multiple stakeholders, and how to communicate with varying personality types
- Problem-solving: Problem solving comes naturally for me, and I approach most roadblocks in my life in a precise and analytical fashion. My undergraduate and postgraduate studies both heavily involved areas of Philosophy where problem solving is incredibly important (Metaphysics, Linguistics etc). I delight in abstraction, and in analytic effiency)

## What I'm working on
I'm currently working on a character sheet that can be used with Dungeos & Dragons 5th Edition with a friend. We're currently working on the various methods and databases in Ruby that will form the backend; as we learn more HTML, CSS and JS we hope to build a good-looking frontend for it, so eventually we have a site we're able to diseminate for usage amongst our friends.  

## What I'd like to work on
I'd like to work on apps that increase the ability of normal people to consume important data; particularly around things like world health. I'd also be interested in working on projects that attempt to tackle issues of social justice (e.g software that makes the world a better place!). There's a tonne of interest for me within this; whether it's apps that aids users to understand how to be more green, software that helps protect privacy, or programs that help share educational material. 

I'd also love to eventually work in a role either focused towards big data, or towards AI - though I'm not at a level where I'd be confident of my ability to contribute meaningfully.

## Personal Interests
I enjoy playing tabletop wargames & RPGs, as well as competitive video games. I'm also a big rugby fan, and both play and watch the sport regularly. I also love running, having run a marathon and a few half marathons before. Finally, I love hardware, astronomy and science fiction - as well as travelling when I get the chance to. 

## Where to find me
In beautiful South London, with my headphones on and a coffee in hand! If not...
