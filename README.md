# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! I'm Karim, a passionate software engineer from London. The midwife who delivered me declared I'd be a gigantic nerd to my mother, and happily, she was proven correct. 

I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and the world in an equitable way. I'm thrilled by software that can help us tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, and focus every moment I have on upskilling as a developer. 

I'm currently employed as a Software Engineer in the Solutions Engineering team at Eigen Technologies in London.

## Personal Interests
I enjoy playing tabletop wargames & RPGs, as well as competitive video games. I'm also a big rugby fan, and both play and watch the sport regularly. I also love running, having run a marathon and a few half marathons before. I enjoy yoga, meditation and keeping mindful; I also love a good podcast! Finally, I love hardware, astronomy and science fiction - as well as travelling when I get the chance.
