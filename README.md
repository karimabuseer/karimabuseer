# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! I'm Karim, a passionate junior full-stack developer from London. The midwife who delivered me declared I'd be a gigantic nerd to my mother, and happily she was proven correct. 

I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and the world in an equitable way. I'm thrilled by software that can help us tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, and focus every moment I have on upskilling as a developer. 

I'm solutions obsessed, and very excited to find the perfect first role where I can continue learning, and began contributing to a product.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Exprience in Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python and C.
- **Problem-solving:** Problem solving comes naturally for me, being heavily required in my undergraduate and postgraduate studies.
- **Debugging and TDD:** Asked to change groups during a bootcamp project due to strong debugging skills and maintaining strong TDD practices; a third party reviewer recently said:
```
Your tests focused on the behaviour of the system, which is excellent.

Your test progression and triangulation is excellent, and you closely triangulated your tests.
```
- **Interpersonal Skills**: I've had the privilege of leading volunteering teams for most of my adult life, alongside working as a Sales Representative for a SaaS start-up for over a year, which has left me with an intimate understanding of how to manage multiple stakeholders, and how to communicate with varying personality types. The aforementioned reviewer recently said: 
```
You were sufficiently vocal about what you were doing and why you are doing it. 
You pitch your reasoning at a good level that shows confidence in your decisions. 
Your reasoning for design and problem-solving decisions were also logically sound. Great job.
```

## Personal Interests
I enjoy playing tabletop wargames & RPGs, as well as competitive video games. I'm also a big rugby fan, and both play and watch the sport regularly. I also love running, having run a marathon and a few half marathons before. I enjoy yoga, meditation and keeping mindful; I also love a good podcast! Finally, I love hardware, astronomy and science fiction - as well as travelling when I get the chance to. 

## Where to find me
In beautiful South London, with my earphones in and a coffee in hand! If not...
