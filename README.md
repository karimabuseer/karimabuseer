# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello there! I'm Karim, a passionate junior full-stack developer from London. The midwife who delivered me declared I'd be a gigantic nerd to my mother, and happily she was proven correct. 

I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and the world in an equitable way. I'm thrilled by software that can help us tackle some of the world's biggest challenges, and focus every moment I have on upskilling as a developer. 

I'm solutions obsessed, and very excited to find the perfect first role where I can continue learning, and began contributing to a product.

## Skills
- **Languages**: Exprience in Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python and C.
- **Problem-solving:** Problem solving comes naturally for me, and I approach most roadblocks in my life in a precise and analytical fashion. My undergraduate and postgraduate studies both heavily involved areas of Philosophy where problem solving is incredibly important (Metaphysics, Linguistics etc). I delight in abstraction, and in analytic effiency)
- Interpersonal Skills: I've had the privilege of leading volunteering teams for most of my adult life, alongside working as a Sales Representative for a SaaS start-up for over a year, which has left me with an intimate understanding of how to manage multiple stakeholders, and how to communicate with varying personality types

## Feedback 
Some of the feedback received from a company hired to test our working practices when studying at Makers' Bootcamp:
```
Your tests were based on the expected inputs and outputs of the system. This is great as it promotes flexibility in your code while keeping it focused on the behaviour of the system.

Your test progression was excellent, and you closely triangulated your tests. This resulted in small and incremental improvements with each passing iteration of your development cycle.
```
```
You were sufficiently vocal about what you were doing and why you are doing it, pitching your reasoning at a good level that showed confidence in your decisions. Your reasoning for design and problem-solving decisions were also logically sound. Great job.
```
My latest review had 6 of 9 subject areas marked as 'Strong', the highest Grade possible - with no subject areas marked as 'Improving'. Please get in touch if you'd like a full copy of my most recent feedback appraisal.

## What I'm working on
I'm currently working on improving the back-end routes of my Chronicle project. Outside of that, I'm currently working through an Algorithmic Complexity course, to give me a better grasp of ways to improve the time complexities of algorithms I write.

## What I'd like to work on
For personal projects I'd like to work on Open Source applications that:
-  Increase the ability of normal people to consume important data; particularly around things like world health
-  Make the world a better place - particular those that aid users to be more green, privacy software, educational software)
For professional prjects I'd like to work on:
- Projects that have several senior engineers working on them
- Projects that are difficult to accomplish (whether conceptually or technically - I thrive on hard challenges)

I'd also love to eventually work in a role either focused towards big data, or towards AI - though I'm not at a level where I'd be confident of my ability to contribute meaningfully to a project of this sort.

## Personal Interests
I enjoy playing tabletop wargames & RPGs, as well as competitive video games. I'm also a big rugby fan, and both play and watch the sport regularly. I also love running, having run a marathon and a few half marathons before. Finally, I love hardware, astronomy and science fiction - as well as travelling when I get the chance to. 

## Where to find me
In beautiful South London, with my headphones on and a coffee in hand! If not...
